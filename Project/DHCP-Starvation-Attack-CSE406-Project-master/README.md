# DHCP-Starvation-Attack-CSE406-Project
A DHCP starvation attack works by broadcasting DHCP requests with spoofed MAC
addresses. If enough requests are sent, the network attacker can exhaust the
address space available to the DHCP servers for a period of time. This is a simple
resource starvation attack just like a synchronization (SYN) flood attack. Network
attackers can then set up a rogue DHCP server on their system and respond to new
DHCP requests from clients on the network
